## **Project Plan: Documentation Scraper and MCP Server**

**Objective:** Develop a Python-based system to scrape framework documentation, store the processed data in a PostgreSQL database with vector capabilities, and serve it through an MCP-compliant server using FastMCP.

---

### **Phase 1: Project Setup**

**Goal:** Establish the development environment and project structure.

**Tasks:**

1. **Initialize Project Repository:**
   - Create a Git repository with the following structure:
     ```
     doc_ingestion/
     ├── crawlers/
     ├── processors/
     ├── server/
     ├── vector_store/
     ├── utils/
     └── README.md
     ```

2. **Install `uv` Package Manager:**
   - Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to install `uv`, a fast Python package manager written in Rust.

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**
   - Use `uv` to create and manage a virtual environment for the project:
     ```bash
     uv venv
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Utilize `uv` to install necessary packages:
     ```bash
     uv pip install crawl4ai psycopg2-binary fastmcp sentence-transformers
     ```
     - `crawl4ai`: For web scraping.
     - `psycopg2-binary`: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
     - `fastmcp`: For building the MCP server.
     - `sentence-transformers`: For generating text embeddings.

---

### **Phase 2: Documentation Scraping**

**Goal:** Extract text content from framework documentation websites using `Crawl4AI`.

**Tasks:**

1. **Integrate `Crawl4AI`:**
   - Set up `Crawl4AI` by installing it and its dependencies:
     ```bash
     uv pip install crawl4ai
     crawl4ai-setup  # Sets up Playwright for browser automation
     ```

2. **Develop Crawling Scripts:**
   - Create modular scripts for each target framework documentation:
     - Utilize `Crawl4AI`'s asynchronous capabilities to efficiently scrape content.
     - Configure `Crawl4AI` to generate clean Markdown output suitable for ingestion.

3. **Handle Dynamic Content:**
   - Leverage `Crawl4AI`'s browser automation features to manage JavaScript-rendered content.

4. **Store Raw Data:**
   - Save the extracted Markdown files locally for preprocessing.
---

### **Phase 3: Data Processing and Embedding**

**Goal:** Clean, chunk, and embed the scraped documentation for storage in PostgreSQL.

**Tasks:**

1. **Text Cleaning:**
   - Remove boilerplate content, navigation links, and unrelated sections from the Markdown files.

2. **Chunking:**
   - Divide the cleaned text into manageable segments, ensuring logical coherence within each chunk.

3. **Embedding Generation:**
   - Generate vector embeddings for each text chunk using `sentence-transformers`.

---

### **Phase 4: Vector Storage with PostgreSQL**

**Goal:** Store and manage vector embeddings within PostgreSQL using the `pgvector` extension.

**Tasks:**

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL:**
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a dedicated database for the project.

2. **Install `pgvector` Extension:**
   - Enable the `pgvector` extension to handle vector data types:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
     ```

3. **Design Database Schema:**
   - Create tables to store:
     - Text chunks and their corresponding embeddings.
     - Metadata such as source URL, framework name, and document section.

4. **Implement Data Operations:**
   - Develop functions to insert, update, delete, and query vector data within PostgreSQL.

---

### **Phase 5: MCP Server Implementation with FastMCP**

**Goal:** Build an MCP-compliant server using `FastMCP` to serve the documentation data.

**Tasks:**

1. **Understand MCP Standards:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) to ensure compliance.

2. **Develop MCP Server with FastMCP:**
   - Utilize `FastMCP` to create the server, defining tools and resources as per MCP standards.

3. **Implement Server Functionalities:**
   - Create functionalities that:
     - Accept user queries.
     - Retrieve relevant document chunks from PostgreSQL based on vector similarity.
     - Return the retrieved information in an MCP-compliant format.

4. **Testing:**
   - Ensure the server correctly interprets MCP requests and provides accurate responses.

---

### **Phase 6: Testing and Deployment**

**Goal:** Validate the system's functionality and deploy it for use.
